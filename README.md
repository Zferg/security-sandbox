# Security Sandbox üèñÔ∏è

> My personal sandbox environment for testing out new
> security tools, vulnerable applications, and using in CTFs.
> Feel free to use this for your own studying or enjoyment!

![Security Sandbox Logo](./images/security-sandbox.png)

## Requirements

There are only two requirements to
get up and running:

- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
- [Hashicorp Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

Once you've got a virtualization solution setup as well as Hashicorp Vagrant, you're ready to go.

## Usage ‚ö°

Set up the Vagrant box and bootstrap it with
my preferred directory structure and workspace environment.

```shell
# Clone the repository with the Github CLI
gh repo clone brittonhayes/security-sandbox

# Start up the primary Kali machine
vagrant up

# The login is
username: vagrant
password: vagrant
```

### Help

To view the available helper commands use `make help`.

```shell
‚ùØ make help
Usage:
kali            Build the Kali box
sandbox         Build the whole sandbox
teardown        Tear down the sandbox
destroy         Destroy the sandbox
```

## Red Team Lab Environment (Optional) üü•

This virtual environment comes with a few testing labs available. 
Pick your flavor!

### Kali

The kali box comes with tor and proxychains setup on boot, so feel free to chain requests through there first.

```shell
# Check tor service
systemctl status tor

# Run a port scan against scanme.nmap.org
# through a tor proxy 
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn scanme.nmap.org 
```

### Juiceshop

```shell
# Start up juiceshop
vagrant up juiceshop

# Navigate to http://192.168.33.20
```

### Damn Vulnerable Web Application

```shell
# Start up DVWA
vagrant up dvwa

# Navigate to http://192.168.33.30
```

### Metasploitable

```shell
# Start up Metasploitable
vagrant up metasploitable

# Navigate to http://192.168.33.40
```

## Blue Team Environment (Optional) üü¶

If you're looking for a good blue team environment to pair with this sandbox, I recommend a [Detection Lab](https://detectionlab.network/) deployment. 

Setup instructions can be found here:
[Detection Lab Deployment Instructions](https://detectionlab.network/deployment/)


## Collaborate Online

If you'd like to collaborate with others on any of the vulnerable web applications, you can use [vagrant share](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/share)
right in the command line. This will create a URL that you can give to anyone and will route directly into your chosen Vagrant environment.

This utilizes a service called [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). For more information, visit ngrok's documentation.

```shell
# Install the plugin
vagrant plugin install vagrant-share

# Share your environment
vagrant share
```
